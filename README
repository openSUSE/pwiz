PWIZ - A Packaging WIZard

Purpose:

PWIZ is a software tool, which should simplify packaging work in
semi-automatic manner.

STATE

In current state, it basically works. Primarilly it is tested on GNOME
related stuff.

INSTALL

Before installation, please install a package installwatch.

Copy pwiz and all related files into ~/pwiz.

Run ./build.sh.

Then do:

cd pwiz
./pwiz

That's all.

LIMITATIONS

Current implementation has following limitations. I am working on its
fixing:

- Only FTP parsing support. No support for build from local files.
- No error processing.
- No support for neededforbuild, Requires etc.
- No support for %pre, %post, %postun, %preun phase splitting to
  subpackages.
- No back steps and random access support.
- Lots of FIXME in code. For user are visible deprecated calls.
- No RPM suid support.
- RPM CXXFLAGS are now hardwired, even if they are unused.
- No support for RPM %ghost.

WARNING

Code is subject to changes.
