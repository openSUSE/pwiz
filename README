PWIZ - A Packaging WIZard

Purpose:

PWIZ is a software tool, which should simplify packaging work in
semi-automatic way.

STATE

In current state, it basically works. Primarilly it is tested on GNOME
related stuff.

RUNNING

Simply run "pwiz" without arguments from command line. PWIZ is self
descriptive.

LIMITATIONS

Current implementation has following limitations. I am working on its
fixing:

- No error processing.
- No support for neededforbuild, Requires etc.
- No support for %pre, %post, %postun, %preun phase splitting to
  subpackages.
- No back steps and random access support.
- Lots of FIXME in code. For user are visible deprecated calls.
- No RPM suid support.
- RPM CXXFLAGS are now hardwired, even if they are unused.
- No support for RPM %ghost.

WARNING

Code is still subject of changes.
