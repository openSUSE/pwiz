PWIZ - A Packaging WIZard

Purpose:

PWIZ is a software tool, which should simplify packaging work by some
steps automatically.

STATE

In current state, there are not yet any manual intervention checkponts,
except question. Promarilly it is tested on GNOME related stuff.

INSTALL

Before installation, please install a package installwatch.

Copy pwiz and all related files into ~/pwiz.

Run ./build.sh.

Then do:

cd pwiz
./pwiz

That's all.

LIMITATIONS

Current implementation has following limitations. I am working on its
fixing:

- No support for manual actions/patches available.
- Only FTP parsing support. No support for build from local files.
- Only single-line answers.
- No error processing.
- No support for neededforbuild, Requires etc.
- No support for %pre, %post, %postun, %preun phase splitting to
  subpackages.
- Not back steps nad random access support.
- Lots of FIXME in code. For user are visible deprecated calls.

WARNING

Code is subject to big changes.
